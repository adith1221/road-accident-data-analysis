🚗 Road Accident Data Analysis Using Python
* This project involves cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing a road accident dataset to understand accident patterns, severity levels, and key contributing factors such as speed limits, weather conditions, and vehicle types.

Project Files
* project5_accident.ipynb – Complete Jupyter Notebook containing the entire workflow
* mm_dirty.csv – Raw dataset used for analysis

🚀 Project Overview
* Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset by handling missing values, fixing incorrect data types, and removing duplicates.
* Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to study accident severity, time-of-day trends, weather impacts, and vehicle involvement.
* Created visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn to uncover meaningful patterns and actionable insights.

🛠️ Technologies Used
* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

📊 Key Analysis Performed
* Correlation heatmap for accident severity, speed limit, and weather factors
* Accident count based on time of day
* Speed limit vs accident severity comparison
* Weather condition impact on accident occurrences
* Vehicle-type contribution analysis
* Histograms, bar charts, box plots, and distribution plots

🧠 Insights & Findings
* Higher speed zones show a clear rise in severe accidents.
* Most accidents occur during evening hours and peak traffic times.
* Poor weather (rain, fog) leads to significantly more accidents.
* Car and bike categories make up the majority of accidents reported.
